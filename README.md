# Guassian Naive Bayes

The repo contains materials for Flatiron School, London's Guassian Naive Bayes Clasifier lecture.
Materials for this lecture were originally developed by David John Baker.

## Materials

* [Exit Ticket]() 

## Learning Objectives 

By the end of the lesson, the student should be able to:

* [ ] Recognize situations where GNB can be applied 
* [ ] Explain what assumptions are needed for predictors and prediction classes in the model 
* [ ] Give an example of when GNB could be applied outside of examples used in the lecture
* [ ] Run the GNB algorithm with code from the lesson notebook
* [ ] Evaluate the output of a GNB classification algorithm 
* [ ] Pros and Cons of NBC 
* [ ] Explain what is "naive" about Naive Bayes Classifiers
